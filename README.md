# Btcbot
Tried to make a bot which takes values from api and changes values. it is not dynamic.
Normally we could use moving averages, exponential moving averages, relative strength index, Fibonacci retracement, Ichimoku cloud, standard deviation, and average directional index. I will use these soon but I dont have that much information for now. 
-My goal was showing an example algorithm to trade.
